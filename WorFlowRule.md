## Branching Strategy

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   ```

2. Create a new branch for your feature or task:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<branch_name>
   ```

3. After working, commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Commit message"
   ```

4. Push the branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<branch_name>
   ```

5. Open a pull request from `feature/<branch_name>` to `main` for code review.
